**1213tnals/1213tnals** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔍 I researched 6Dof manipulator trajectories for automated robot arm system at [HRRLAB](http://www.hrrlab.com/), which is Humanoid Robot Research Lab. While I was a member of that Lab, I also made a intergrated mobile manipulator system which was able to be controlled by VR controller.   
- 🌱 I am currently learning 3D reconstruction algorithms and extended reality (XR) programming using Unity to build a human-centered interaction system. My ultimate goal is to create a service that allows people to relive their precious moments, offering them inspiration and empowerment.
